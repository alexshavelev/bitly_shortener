# Bitly url shorterer

Project can be used to shorten url and then check its clicks count

### How to install

Register on http://bitly.com and click GENERATE ACCES TOKEN. It looks like 'dcdf6d1bdsd770fb069703f5a5e1c51e37ef67a8'.
Then create '.env' file and put token here in next format 'TOKEN=\'dcdf6d1bdsd770fb069703f5a5e1c51e37ef67a8\''

[TODO: tell user where he should get keys, where they should be and how they look like]

Python3 should be already installed.
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
